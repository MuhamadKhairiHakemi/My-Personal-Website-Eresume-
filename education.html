        <p>“Education is not an affair of 'telling' and being told, but an active and constructive process. The school must represent present life, as real and vital to the child as that which he carries on in the home, in the neighborhood, or on the playground.”</p> 
        <p> -John Dewey, 20th Century Educational Reformer</p>
        <p>"Education breeds confidence. Confidence breeds hope. Hope breeds peace. By nature, men are nearly alike; by practice, they get to be wide apart. Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous."</p>

      <h3>🌱 Kindergarten Era: Where It All Began</h3>
      <p class="edu-paragraph">
       My academic journey started at Tadika Ceria Az-Zahrah, where I took my first steps into structured learning. This was where I learned the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic—skills that would become the foundation of my education. But beyond academics, kindergarten was about discovering the joy of learning. I remember singing nursery rhymes with my teachers, playing games with friends, and even participating in my first school performance. The colorful classrooms, storytime sessions, and simple art projects made every day exciting. Most importantly, I developed social skills—sharing toys, taking turns, and working in groups—lessons that stayed with me long after I moved on to primary school.</p>
      <p><em>
      Looking back, kindergarten wasn’t just about ABCs and 123s; it was where I first understood that learning could be fun. This early enthusiasm became the spark that fueled my curiosity in later years—whether it was raising my hand eagerly in primary school science class or volunteering for presentations in university.

      <h3>🎒 Primary School Era: Building Confidence & Curiosity</h3>
      <p>
        My primary years were split between SK Telok Pulai, for national curriculum and SRA Sungai Udang, for religious studies. This dual education system taught me discipline and time management early on. Academically, I discovered my love for science experiments, language arts and variety of information, often getting lost in storybooks during library time.
        <p>
I also began participating in school competitions, from spelling bees to sports day, which helped me build confidence. One of my proudest moments was achieving strong results in UPSR and PSRA, proving that hard work pays off. Outside the classroom, I took on small leadership roles, like becoming a class representative, which planted the seeds of responsibility and teamwork.
      <p><em>
        The challenges of balancing two schools taught me adaptability—a skill that later helped me juggle extracurriculars in secondary school. My early leadership roles also set the stage for more responsibilities, like becoming a prefect and club president. Even my love for reading didn’t fade; it evolved into researching academic papers at university.

      <h3>📘 Secondary School Era: Shaping Ambitions & Character</h3>
      <p>
        At Sam Sultan Hisamuddin, my world expanded. The stricter schedule, heavier workload, and PT3, SPM and SMA exams pushed me to become more disciplined. I joined clubs and societies, from debate team to STEM, where I learned to balance academics with extracurriculars. Friendships deepened, and mentors helped me navigate challenges—whether it was tackling algebra or preparing for presentations. This was also the era where I began seriously thinking about my future. Career talks, internship opportunities, and my first part-time job made me realize the importance of setting goals. By the time I graduated, I had not only gained knowledge but also a stronger sense of self-discipline and resilience.
      <p><em>
       Secondary school was the bridge between childhood and adulthood. The study habits I developed here became crucial in university, where independent learning was essential. My involvement in clubs also revealed my passion for organization—leading me to pursue Library Informatics, where I now apply those skills in managing information systems.

      <h3>🎓 University Era: Independence & New Horizons</h3>
      <p>
       Now at UiTM Kedah, pursuing Library Informatics, I’m experiencing the most transformative chapter yet. University life is a blend of freedom and responsibility—managing my own schedule, budgeting, and making important decisions. The coursework challenges me with research projects, data management, and digital archiving, while group assignments sharpen my teamwork and communication skills. Living away from home has taught me self-reliance, and campus activities (like seminars and volunteer work) have expanded my network. Every day brings new lessons, whether it’s mastering a software tool or learning to adapt to different personalities in group work. I know these years will define my professional path—and I’m excited to see where they lead.
      <p><em>
       If kindergarten taught me to love learning, university is teaching me how to learn for life. The skills I’m gaining now—from critical thinking to digital literacy—are the tools I’ll use to build my career. Just as my teachers in Tadika Ceria Az-Zahrah encouraged my first steps, my professors now guide me toward my future. The journey continues, but every era has prepared me for what’s next.
