  <h2>🎮 Hobbies: Gaming Hours & Favorites</h2>
  <p>
    Gaming is my favorite hobby because it’s more than just entertainment—it’s an adventure, a challenge, and a way to connect with others. Whether I’m exploring vast virtual worlds, competing in fast-paced matches, or simply relaxing with a casual game, there’s always something exciting to dive into.
  </p>
  <p>
    What makes gaming truly special to me is its versatility. It can be a solo journey where I lose myself in breathtaking fantasy realms, or a social experience where teamwork and friendly rivalries thrive. The thrill of overcoming a tough boss, the satisfaction of solving a complex puzzle, and the adrenaline rush of a last-second victory—these moments keep me coming back to my favorite games day after day.

      <h3>🖥️ PC Games</h3>
      <p>
        PC gaming offers an incredible variety of experiences, and some of my favorite titles showcase this diversity perfectly. Valorant tests my tactical FPS skills with its precise gunplay and team-based strategy, strengthened by osu!, a rhythm and reflexes game with its fast-paced clicking patterns, turning music into an intense, skill-based challenge. For action RPG lovers, I love Punishing: Gray Raven, a RPG game that comes with a fluid combat system and stunning cyberpunk aesthetic, rewarding players who master its combo-heavy gameplay and Etheria: Restart, a MMORPG experience with turn-based style, modern polish, blending exploration, crafting, and social interaction in a vibrant fantasy world.

      <h3>📱 Mobile Games</h3>
      <p>
       Mobile gaming brings incredible diversity to our fingertips, and some of my favorite titles demonstrate this range beautifully. Honor of Kings which is delivers intense MOBA action with fast-paced 5v5 battles, where strategy and critical thinking plus a teamwork decide victory. PUBG Mobile offers heart-pounding battle royal gameplay, mixing survival tactics with precise shooting in ever-shrinking zones. For rhythm game enthusiasts, Project Sekai: Hatsune Miku combines vibrant anime-style visuals with addictive music gameplay, featuring beloved Vocaloid tracks there’s 4 versions which is Global, Japanese, Korean and Chinese version. I recommended you to play the Japanese version to fulfill the experience of early birds. If you are the person who likely play a relax game, then there’s Minecraft, the ultimate sandbox experience that fuels creativity through building, exploration, and endless possibilities—whether playing solo or with friends.

      <h3>🕹️ Arcade Machines</h3>
      <p>
       Arcade gaming offers some of the most physically immersive and rhythmically intense experiences in gaming, and this is my favorite that people really should try if you like arcade games. Maimai, a game that combines touch-screen mechanics with circular motion controls, creating a dynamic rhythm game that feels like dancing on a giant music player. CHUNITHM elevates the experience with its air-based note system, where players wave their hands to hit floating musical cues in perfect sync. For pure drumming exhilaration, Taiko no Tatsujin delivers addictive beats with its traditional Japanese taiko drumming gameplay—simple to learn but tough to master. And for racing fans, Initial D Arcade Stage throws players into high-speed drift battles, replicating the adrenaline of touge racing with its hydraulic motion cabinets and competitive time attacks.

        <h3>Colorful Stage! The Movie: A Miku Who Can't Sing (2025)</h3>

        <h3>Now You See Me 2 (2016)</h3>
        <p>
          The thrilling saga of the Four Horsemen, a team of illusionists who use their skills to expose corruption. After a year in hiding, J. Daniel Atlas, Merritt McKinney, Jack Wilder, and new recruit Lula May resurface to disrupt the launch of a shady tech mogul’s product. However, their plan backfires when they are ambushed by Walter Mabry, a cunning villain who blackmails them into stealing a dangerous data-harvesting device called "The Stick."
        <p>
          Forced into a high-stakes heist in Macau, the Horsemen must outwit both their enemies and the authorities, including FBI agent Dylan Rhodes and Interpol’s Natalie Austin. The film ramps up the magic with dazzling set pieces, including a show-stopping card-throwing sequence and mind-bending illusions, while unraveling deeper secrets about the mysterious Eye society. Along the way, alliances are tested, betrayals are revealed, and the team must rely on their wits to stay one step ahead.
        <p>
          Packed with twists, humor, and star power—including Daniel Radcliffe as the villain and returning actors Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine—the film blends heist thrills with supernatural flair. Though it leaves room for a sequel, Now You See Me 2 delivers an entertaining ride, proving that the Horsemen’s greatest trick is keeping audiences guessing until the very end.

        <h3>Bagman (2024)</h3>
        <p>
          In Bagman, Sam Claflin stars as Patrick McKee, a desperate father trying to escape financial and emotional ruin. Hoping for a fresh start, he relocates his wife, Karina (Antonia Thomas), and young son to his rural childhood home. But as they settle into the sleepy town, a dark chapter from Patrick's past resurfaces—the haunting local legend of the Bagman.
        <p>
          The Bagman is no ordinary urban myth. This malevolent entity, described as a towering figure cloaked in shadows and carrying a decaying sack, is said to punish "bad" children by stealing them away forever. Patrick, who once narrowly escaped the Bagman’s grasp as a child, is now plagued by disturbing visions and eerie occurrences that convince him the monster has returned—with his son as the target.
        <p>
          As the supernatural threat escalates, Patrick’s grip on reality begins to slip. He becomes obsessed with protecting his son, even as his community dismisses his fears as delusions. Torn between his traumatic memories and the growing danger around him, Patrick must confront his inner demons—and the terrifying Bagman—before it’s too late.
